# hadijatek_haskell

Hadijáték is a Diplomacy-like game invented at BME's FEB camp.

This project was done without much experience with large projects,
and has a large amount of bugs.

Development is being continued:
I am currently in the process of rewriting everything in Rust,
in a far more organized way.
